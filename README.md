To clone the repo follow these steps if using Windows:

create a folder to store the project

open a terminal in that folder

run the following commands from that folder:

npm update

npm install nodejs

npm cache clean -f

npm install -g nodemon

npm create vite@latest -> select react -> select typescript

Now, clone the repo to a separate folder 

open a terminal in your frontend folder

run npm install

copy paste the entire contents of the repo folder into the original folder you made and replace existing files(where you ran the commands)

remove the cloned repo from github desktop

Add the repo (the folder you installed the commands in) to Github Desktop. Add -> Add Existing -> Select your folder -> add repository
